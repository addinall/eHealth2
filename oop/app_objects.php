//  SYNOPSIS:   This file contains the object that will 
//              encapsulate general application objects in use.
//              This file changes per development, howver
//              most objects can be found in common systems
//              that have people and organisations.

//              the years.  Apart from the quicktools suite,

//              and several specific applications, ACCLOUD
//              accounting, What's Mine (Mining industry ERP
//              and assett management) and BetMe, a horce racing
