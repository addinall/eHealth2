Another go at my eHealth systems.

Two reasons for this site, I want to test some new tools and techniques (as usual) and since my last eHealth
site ( http://www.addinall.net/ehealth/ ) was published in 2010, I thought it time for an update.

I have remained VERY keen towards eHealth, BioInformatics and the Life sciences in general since 2010 and
have completed a number of related courses detailed here at http://www.addinall.net/Recent_results/compile.pdf my site.

Tools used for this version include:

- an update version of my PHP OOD/OOP db and utility routines
- Bootstrap
- Angular
